Factors such as diabetes, infections, and physical injuries often contribute to these nerve issues.

**The Role of Supplements in Nerve Health**

Natural supplements, derived from plant-based sources, offer an alternative to synthetic options, aiming to provide essential nutrients that support nerve function and alleviate discomfort.
